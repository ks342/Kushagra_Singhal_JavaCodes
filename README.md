# Kushagra_Singhal_JavaCodes


Hi, this repository has my solutions for the coding test.

I solved all 4 problems in **Java**. Each problem is in a separate file:

- Problem1.java → Calculator (add, sub, mul, div)  
- Problem2.java → Prints odd numbers up to input  
- Problem3.java → Prints conditional odd series based on input rules  
- Problem4.java → Counts how many numbers are divisible by other numbers in the array
